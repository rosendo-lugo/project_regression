1. How does the location of a property impact its assessed value?

Visualization:
Heatmap of property values by county, showing the variation in assessed values across different locations.
Bar chart comparing the average assessed values of properties in different counties.

Transition:
Transition from the location question to the property size question by highlighting the importance of location as a primary factor in property value determination.

Statistical Test:
Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) or Kruskal-Wallis test to compare the assessed values of properties in different locations.

Hypothesis: The location of a property has a significant impact on its assessed value.

Hypothesis Test:
Null Hypothesis (H0): The location of a property does not have a significant impact on its assessed value.
Alternative Hypothesis (HA): The location of a property has a significant impact on its assessed value.

To test this hypothesis, we can use either the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) or the Kruskal-Wallis test, depending on the assumptions of the data.

For ANOVA:
H0: The mean assessed values of properties are equal across different locations.
HA: The mean assessed values of properties are not equal across different locations.

For Kruskal-Wallis:
H0: The assessed values of properties are equal across different locations.
HA: The assessed values of properties are not equal across different locations.

By performing the ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis test and analyzing the resulting p-value, we can determine whether there is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the location of a property has a significant impact on its assessed value.

2. How does the square footage of a property relate to its assessed value?

Visualization:

Scatter plot showing the relationship between the square footage and assessed value of properties, with a regression line.
Box plot comparing the distribution of assessed values across different size categories (e.g., small, medium, large properties).

Transition:
Transition from the property size question to the number of bedrooms/bathrooms question by discussing the influence of property size on value.

Statistical Test:
Pearson's correlation coefficient or Spearman's rank correlation to measure the strength and direction of the relationship between square footage and assessed value.

Hypothesis: There is a significant correlation between the square footage of a property and its assessed value.


3. What is the relationship between the number of bedrooms/bathrooms and the assessed value?

Visualization:

Box plot comparing the assessed values of properties based on the number of bedrooms or bathrooms.
Violin plot displaying the distribution of assessed values for different bedroom or bathroom counts.
Transition:

Transition from the number of bedrooms/bathrooms question to the property age question by discussing the impact of property characteristics on value.
Statistical Test:

Independent samples t-test or Mann-Whitney U test to compare the assessed values of properties with different bedroom or bathroom counts.
Hypothesis: Properties with a higher number of bedrooms or bathrooms have a significantly different assessed value compared to properties with fewer bedrooms or bathrooms.


4. Does the year built of a property affect its assessed value? Are newer properties generally assessed at higher values?

Visualization:

Line plot showing the average assessed value of properties over time, categorized by different age groups.
Box plot comparing the assessed values of newer and older properties.
Transition:

Transition from the property age question to the conclusion by summarizing the findings of all the previous questions.
Statistical Test:

Independent samples t-test or Mann-Whitney U test to compare the assessed values of newer and older properties.
Hypothesis: There is a significant difference in the assessed values of newer and older properties.
By presenting these questions in a sorted order, with visualizations, transitions, and statistical tests, you can provide stakeholders with a clear and meaningful roadmap for understanding the key drivers of property value.
